## 4.3.2. Description

Powerful toolkit for bioinformatics. Can run in batch or interactive mode

### Advantages

1. Rich library with many functionalities
2. Has batch-mode that allows creating file with all commands (creating
   pipeline)
3. Multithread by default (use all virtual cores). Can set exact number of
   cores
4. Clustering with many options and few implemented algorithms
5. Distance matrix can use one from defined metrics (7 available)
6. Can be used as preprocessing / postprocessing tool for other programs

### Drawbacks
1. Most clustering algorithms requires distance matrix
2. Unconventional user interface - it was a little hard to start using it
