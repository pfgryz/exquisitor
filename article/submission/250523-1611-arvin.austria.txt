Dear Dr Nowak,

Thank you for starting your submission to BMC Bioinformatics. We’re looking forward to receiving your manuscript.

We check manuscripts for common issues before we send them to the
editor. If we find any problems, we’ll ask you to make changes.

We do not want anything to be delayed, so here are some tips to make sure your submission goes smoothly:

• add in permissions or credit if you include images that are not your own
• make sure you know the details of your contributing authors, including affiliated institutions
• if you are reporting experiments on live subjects, make sure you include an ethics or approval statement
• competing interests need to include financial and non-financial interests, for example, business or family interests
• make sure there are no differences between the manuscript file and the information you provide in the submission system
